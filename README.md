      </ul>
      <li>MongoDB</li>

  <li>Once all is installed, open the phone emulator you set up as well as two command prompts and within the Exercise365 directory, have one prompt within the base Exercise365 directory, and one within the server directory.</li>
  <li>Within the base directory, enter "npm start", and within the server directory, enter "node index.js"</li>
  <li>When prompted in the base directory to choose how to run the app, type "a" and Exercise365 should start loading onto your emulator</li>

Now the app is running, enjoy!
