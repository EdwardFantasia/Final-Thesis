Exercise365 is a React Native application using the MERN + Firebase Stack.
In order to run Exercise365, one must have Android Studio, NodeJS, and MongoDB installed.
This app runs best when a Pixel 8 is the device being emulated, here is a video to help with setup.
Once all is installed, open two command prompts and within the Exercise365 directory, have one prompt within the base Exercise365 directory, and one within the server directory.
Within the base directory, enter "npm start", and within the server directory, enter "node index.js"
Now the app is running, enjoy!
